# Bit by Bit - Atbash
Atbash is a messaging application, where the privacy of users and their messages is the top priority. Atbash provides end-to-end encryption with the use of the [Signal Encryption Protocol](https://signal.org/docs/) which is currently the state of the art for end-to-end encryption applications. Atbash even takes this a step further by encrypting the sender and receiver addresses on messages using a solution proposed in a recently [published paper](https://cs-people.bu.edu/kaptchuk/publications/ndss21.pdf)
